This is my [Personal Website](https://oragazzo.com/) project made using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for frontend and [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/pt/actions) for CI/CD.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
